## Approvals Process

In this phase of GEPD implementation, obtaining necessary approvals is essential for beginning the data collection process. Since approval requirements vary by country, this step provides a list of common approvals and the institutions that usually require them. This ensures a well-informed approach so that the local team meets country-specific regulatory needs.

Two primary types of approvals are typically necessary:

1.  Ethical Approval;
2.  Approvals requested from the National Statistics Agency - (if applicable).

The Approvals topic can be approached during the [Initial Meeting](https://arthurcheib.github.io/gepd-implementation-pck/s1_confirm-country.html#conducting-the-meeting), where the specific approvals required in the country through for the data collection can be clarified in the discussions with government officials.

This step involves understanding and adhering to country-specific processes and requirements. Thus, in order to have this topic well-covered, the local team has to work closely with the Survey Firm - **mainly because in most implementations they are the ones responsible for ensuring all approvals are obtained.**
