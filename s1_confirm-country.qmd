## **About this phase:**

Step 1's primary goal **is to secure a country's participation in the Global Education Policy Dashboard (GEPD)**. This process begins with identifying a potential need for the GEPD in a country and then arranging and conducting an initial meeting to present the Dashboard's capabilities. A follow-up email is sent post-meeting to confirm participation and outline the next steps and most immediate actions required. Finally, once participation is confirmed, the TTL coordinates communication accordingly, guaranteeing the necessary information exchange for the project advancement.

## **Step-by-step:**

### 1.1 - Opportunity Window: Identifying a need for the Dashboard

At this moment, the task is to pinpoint a specific need within a country that the GEPD can effectively address. This process might involve analyzing situations where the Dashboard can serve as a potent solution. These needs can be identified proactively by investigating the country's education policy landscape or in response to a direct request from the country. The goal is to establish the GEPD as a fitting tool that aligns with the country's educational objectives and challenges.

### 1.2 - Requesting an Initial Meeting

In this phase, the focus shifts to the TTL **arranging an initial meeting with key stakeholders in the potential counterpart country**. This meeting is planned to last 60-90 minutes, and is intended to delve deeper into the Dashboard's capabilities and relevance to the country's needs. Preparation for this meeting involves sending a well-crafted introductory email to the country's representatives, accompanied by essential resources, which includes the Implementation Brief and the Reference Guide. These documents should provide more details on the Dashboard, illustrating its capacity to meet the country's specific data requirements.

### 1.3 - Conducting the Meeting

Once the initial meeting is set, the TTL prepares to lead the discussion with a structured approach. The suggested agenda for the meeting is for it to start with a 20-minute presentation on the GEPD, utilizing the provided sample presentation -- of course, this presentation needs to be tailored for the country in question. The presentation aims to give a comprehensive overview of the Dashboard's functionality and benefits. Following the presentation, the TTL dedicates the remaining time to address various key aspects, such as:

-   Responding to questions about the project's scope, objectives, and potential impact.​

-   Discussing the specifics of the implementation process.​

-   Detailing the requirements from the country: ​

    -   Appointing a focal point​;

    -   Providing necessary information for sampling​;

    -   Understanding the required approvals documents.

-   Aiming to confirm the country\'s participation in the GEPD
