### **Sampling Process**

The Global Education Policy Dashboard (GEPD) employs a sophisticated two-stage random sampling design to ensure the collection of nationally representative and high-quality data. The sampling strategy adopted by GEPD allows for precise detection of variations over time, as well as differences based on urban/rural locations and gender. In the first stage, a stratified sampling approach is used, considering geographical regions and urban/rural classifications to select schools. This ensures a diverse and representative sample that accurately mirrors the country's educational settings.

In the second stage, within the selected schools, a random sample of teachers and students is chosen for interviews and assessments. This level of granularity allows the GEPD to delve into the nuances of educational experiences at the individual level. The process is designed to be adaptable, taking into account the specific educational and geographical contexts of each country.

### **Sampling - 1st Stage**

**Receive the Country's List of Schools:** At this point, the country has shared an up-to-date list containing all of its schools and all the necessary information about each of them (the columns we need can be found at the substep 1.4 of Confirming Country's Participation).

**Use the Sampling Tool:** The app below is designed to assist in the stratification and random selection process, ensuring efficiency and accuracy. Here is a quick step-by-step of how it can be used:

- Upload your excel or csv file containing the list of schools
- Choose the sample size of schools you desire
- Choose one or two columns that you want to use for stratification
- Run the sampling!
- Visualize the schools selected
- Download your file containing the schools sampled

**Finalize and Document School List:** Concisely review and confirm the selected schools' list, ensuring it aligns with representativeness and feasibility criteria, and include backup schools for potential non-responses.

**Maintain consistent communication with the GEPD central team** for quality checks and feedback integration. Thoroughly document every aspect of the sampling process, including stratification rationale, school selection, and any encountered challenges, and report these details back to the central team for review and record-keeping.
