    "text": "Sampling Process\nSampling is a critical step in data collection for the Global Education Policy Dashboard (GEPD). It ensures that the data we gather is representative of the entire population, allowing us to draw meaningful and accurate conclusions about education policy and its effects.\nThe GEPD employs a robust two-stage sampling strategy to select schools and public officials. Initially, around 200 schools are chosen based on urban/rural classification and regions, ensuring every geographical division is accounted for. Subsequently, we randomly pick teachers and students within these schools for surveying. For public officials, a similar strategy is applied, but with a focus on different administrative levels to create a linked data chain from local to central offices.\n\n\nStep-by-step!\nThis video will guide you through how to entire process, from uploading your data to selecting your sample size.\n\n\n\nReady to sample?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Policymakers in low - and middle - income countries who are working to improve student learning often find themselves flying blind. They see the budget that goes into education and (sometimes) the learning that students come out with, but they lack information on many of the crucial factors in between—the practices, policies, and politics—that drive those learning outcomes. The Global Education Policy Dashboard (GEPD) shines a light on those hidden drivers. To tackle the learning crisis, achieving and sustaining learning gains at scale, countries need to know where they stand on all three of these dimensions—practices (or service delivery), policies, and politics."

    "text": "The Dashboard\nThe Global Education Policy Dashboard (GEPD), developed by the World Bank’s Education Global Practice, can help countries reduce Learning Poverty. This tool offers a strong basis for identifying priorities for investment and policy reforms that are suited to each country context. It does so by (1) highlighting gaps between what the evidence suggests is effective in promoting learning and what is happening in practice in each system; and (2) allowing governments to track progress as they take action to close those gaps. The GEPD has been implemented in seven education systems and preparation is ongoing in eight more with expected completion by the end of 2024.\nGEPD collects new data in each country using three new instruments: a School Survey, a Policy Survey, and a Survey of Public Officials. Data collection involves school visits, classroom observations, legislative reviews, teacher and student assessments, and interviews with teachers, principals, and public officials. A major objective of the GEPD project was to develop focused, cost-effective instruments and data-collection procedures, so that the dashboard can be inexpensive enough to be applied (and re-applied) in many countries."
