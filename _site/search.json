    "text": "Step-by-step:\n\n1.1 - Opportunity Window: Identifying a need for the Dashboard\nAt this moment, the task is to pinpoint a specific need within a country that the GEPD can effectively address. This process might involve analyzing situations where the Dashboard can serve as a potent solution. These needs can be identified proactively by investigating the country’s education policy landscape or in response to a direct request from the country. The goal is to establish the GEPD as a fitting tool that aligns with the country’s educational objectives and challenges.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2 - Requesting an Initial Meeting\nIn this phase, the focus shifts to the TTL arranging an initial meeting with key stakeholders in the potential counterpart country. This meeting is planned to last 60-90 minutes, and is intended to delve deeper into the Dashboard’s capabilities and relevance to the country’s needs. Preparation for this meeting involves sending a well-crafted introductory email to the country’s representatives, accompanied by essential GEPD’s resources and the link for GEPD’s Website. These documents should provide more details on the Dashboard, illustrating its capacity to meet the country’s specific data requirements.\n1.2.1 - RESOURCES AVAILABLE:\n\nImplementation Brief: English | French | Spanish | Arabic | Portuguese\nReference Guide: English | French | Spanish | Arabic | Portuguese\nSample Email: English | French | Spanish | Arabic | Portuguese\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3 - Conducting the Meeting\nOnce the initial meeting is set, the TTL prepares to lead the discussion. The suggested agenda for the meeting is for it to start with a 20-minute presentation on the GEPD, utilizing the provided sample presentation, which needs to be tailored for the country in question. The presentation aims to give a comprehensive overview of the Dashboard’s functionality and benefits. Following the presentation, the TTL dedicates the remaining time to address various key aspects, such as:\n\nResponding to questions about the project’s scope, objectives, and potential impact.\nDiscussing the specifics of the implementation process.\nDetailing the requirements from the country:\n\nAppointing a focal point;\nProviding necessary information for sampling;\nUnderstanding the required approvals documents.\n\nAiming to confirm the country’s participation in the GEPD\n\n1.3.1 - RESOURCES AVAILABLE:\n\nSample Presentation: English | French | Spanish | Arabic | Portuguese\nMeeting’s FAQ: English | French | Spanish | Arabic | Portuguese\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4 - Next Steps Email (following-up after Initial Meeting)\nAfter the initial meeting, the following action is to send a comprehensive follow-up email to the country’s representatives. This email should be structured to provide clarity and direction, ensuring the country’s representatives are fully informed of the requirements and upcoming phases in the GEPD implementation process. Its essential purposes are:\n\nReiteration and Documentation: It includes the presentation delivered during the meeting as an attachment, serving as a reference point and reinforcing the discussed topics.\nConfirmation of Participation: If the country’s participation was confirmed during the meeting, the email will formally acknowledge this and express appreciation for the commitment.\nOutlining Next Steps: Importantly, the email will detail the subsequent steps required to move the GEPD project forward. This includes:\n\nCreating a project timeline, providing a clear schedule of activities and milestones.\nRequesting sample data for the schools and public officials survey, guided by the attached Excel table format.\nEstablishing contact with the focal point to facilitate data collection and follow-up communications.\nProvide the counterpart with all the actions needed from their side\n\n\n1.4.1 - RESOURCES AVAILABLE:\n\nNext Steps Sample Email: English | French | Spanish | Arabic | Portuguese\nSchool Information: English | French | Spanish | Arabic | Portuguese\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.5 - Establishing Channels of Communication\nOnce the country’s participation is confirmed and the first communications starts to happen, the TTL’s role shifts towards maintaining momentum and ensuring effective communication. The primary focus at this stage involves two critical aspects:\n\nRefining the Project Timeline: The TTL must work closely with the country’s team to develop a comprehensive timeline for the GEPD implementation. This timeline should outline all key phases, milestones, and deadlines, providing a clear roadmap for the project.\nFacilitating Information and Data Exchange: Ongoing interaction between the TTL and the country’s team is essential. The TTL will coordinate the exchange of necessary information and data, ensuring that both sides have what they need for successful implementation. This exchange is crucial for tailoring the GEPD to the country’s specific needs.\n\nThe TTL should approach this phase with a focus on clear, consistent communication and collaboration. Keeping the lines of communication open will ensure that any challenges or questions are promptly addressed, and the project stays on track."

    "text": "Addressing the Learning Crisis\nPolicymakers in low - and middle - income countries who are working to improve student learning often find themselves flying blind. They see the budget that goes into education and (sometimes) the learning that students come out with, but they lack information on many of the crucial factors in between—the practices, policies, and politics—that drive those learning outcomes. The Global Education Policy Dashboard (GEPD) shines a light on those hidden drivers. To tackle the learning crisis, achieving and sustaining learning gains at scale, countries need to know where they stand on all three of these dimensions—practices (or service delivery), policies, and politics."

    "text": "The Dashboard\nThe Global Education Policy Dashboard (GEPD), developed by the World Bank’s Education Global Practice, can help countries reduce Learning Poverty. This tool offers a strong basis for identifying priorities for investment and policy reforms that are suited to each country context. It does so by (1) highlighting gaps between what the evidence suggests is effective in promoting learning and what is happening in practice in each system; and (2) allowing governments to track progress as they take action to close those gaps. The GEPD has been implemented in seven education systems and preparation is ongoing in eight more with expected completion by the end of 2024.\nGEPD collects new data in each country using three new instruments: a School Survey, a Policy Survey, and a Survey of Public Officials. Data collection involves school visits, classroom observations, legislative reviews, teacher and student assessments, and interviews with teachers, principals, and public officials. A major objective of the GEPD project was to develop focused, cost-effective instruments and data-collection procedures, so that the dashboard can be inexpensive enough to be applied (and re-applied) in many countries."
